UX changes to the page (what to change on-screen)

Replace the current “Our Commitment / Services (What I Handle)” blocks with real sections above (accordion or long-form).

Keep the top nav chips, but make them anchor links to the real sections.

Add “Last updated” under the subtitle.

On policy pages, make the right-side lead box smaller (or remove the “What happens next” card) so it doesn’t visually compete with legal content.
